# Supplementary materials supporting the findings of the article entitled TGF-α - EGFR pathway in breast carcinogenesis, association with WWOX expression and estrogen activation by Pospiech et al.


This repository offers supplementary files supporting the anlysis of the association of WWOX and estrogen receptor expression in breast cancer cell lines enclosed in the article by Pospiech et al. entitled TGF-α - EGFR pathway in breast carcinogenesis, association with WWOX expression and estrogen activation, currently cosidered by the Journal of Applied Genetics for publication.


It includes:

Table S1: Influence of WWOX regulation on adhesion according to breast cancer cell lines.

Table S2: Influence of WWOX regulation and estradiol treatment on adhesion according to breast cancer cell lines.

Table S3: A list of all 13076 transcripts identified in examined cell lines with their TPM values as well as ENCODE and ChEA ERalpha and ERbeta target genes and their TPM expression numbers, TMP>5 filtered and fold change values used in this analysis (the following sheets before Supplementary Table 4).

Table S4: Lists of estrogen (ESR1) target genes showing mutually exclusive expression or co-expression in MCF7, BT20, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines according to WWOX protein level (FC change WWOXlow vs WWOXhigh) after 24hrs E2 treatment.

Table S5: Lists of estrogen (ESR2) target genes showing mutually exclusive expression or co-expression in MCF7, BT20, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines according to WWOX protein level (FC change WWOXlow vs WWOXhigh) after 24hrs E2 treatment.

Table S6: Lists of estrogen (ESR1a2) target genes showing mutually exclusive expression or co-expression in MCF7, BT20, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines according to WWOX protein level (FC change WWOXlow vs WWOXhigh) after 24hrs E2 treatment.

Table S7: The list transcription factors and ERα co-targeted genes.

Table S8: The differential expression of 98 genes classified by GO to regulation of signaling in MCF7 cells.
